Java Chat Application

This is a multi-client chat application developed in Java using socket programming. The application allows multiple users to connect to a server and exchange messages in real-time. 
Each user can send and receive messages from other connected users, simulating a chat room environment.

Features

Multi-client support: Multiple clients can connect to the server simultaneously.

Real-time communication: Messages are instantly sent and received between users.

Server-client architecture: The server handles multiple clients, and each client operates independently.

Threading: Each client connection is handled by a separate thread on the server for concurrency.

Broadcast messaging: Messages sent by a client are broadcast to all connected clients.

Technologies Used

Java: Core programming language for both server and client-side functionality.

Socket Programming: Enables communication between server and clients.

Multithreading: Ensures smooth communication between multiple clients and the server.
